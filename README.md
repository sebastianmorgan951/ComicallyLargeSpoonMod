**What is added**
Copper ore, blocks, and ingots
    No current recipe for some of this stuff, this
    repository is a work in progress with random stuff
Copper tools, armor, and a coppered apple!
    The tools and armor are fairly standard
    Coppered apple has some cool functionality!
        Hit a sheep with one and it gets consumed,
        then the sheep glows!
        Hit any mob with it 10 times, the coppered
        apple will heal the mob as you hit it, then
        the mob will be able to pick up any block,
        whether or not the block displays in their
        hand depends on the mob
            Then, if you throw a diamond block at that
            mob and it picks up the diamond block,
            the mob gets deleted from existence
Mounds
    Added a cool block model which is essentially
    a pile a wood and mossy cobblestone, and it can
    store a single sword-weapon within it if you right
    click the mound with a sword. Then, the mound will
    render displaying the sword in-game! Finally,
    you can right click the mound with a different 
    sword to replace the one the mound is holding,
    then the mound will drop the exact sword you gave
    it earlier.
Comically Large Spoon
    Added a high damage, low attack-speed weapon which
    has a large 3d model! This can only generate inside
    of mounds very rarely, however I am still trying
    to get its natural generation to work well.
Geisel Block
    I attend UCSD, and we have a very distinct library,
    so I created a block model for our library and
    added it as a cool block you can decorate with (:
